# Landscape Archaeology hands-on training exercises
Those materials have been created to support training activities developed by members of the Landscape Archaeology Research Group of the Catalan Institute of Classical Archaeology (http://giap.icac.cat/).

The exercises had been designed according to practical questions of GIAP-ICAC members research activity. Each exercise covers one specific area, and it can be done individually, although some may require specific previous knowledge. A group of exercises can be organised as a "training course." In that case, the course materials will provide links to the different exercises in a specific order to achieve the course goals.
