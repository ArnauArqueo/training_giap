This exercise introduces the use of GIS to collect field data on a digital format. The example presented here is designed so it can be applied in any geographic area and to be easily adapted by the students.

The exercise is based in Qfield (https://qfield.org/), an open source project linked to QGIS. The exercise has been created in a way that can be completed without any previous knowledge of Qfield. It requires also the use of QGIS desktop (the present document has been elaborated using the 3.12 version of QGIS, note that some inconsistencies might arise due further updates. Contact your instructor if you encounter any difficulty). Basic QGIS functions needed here are covered in [e1](https://github.com/ArnauArqueo/training_giap/tree/main/e1_optical_telegraph) and [e2](https://github.com/ArnauArqueo/training_giap/tree/main/e2_photointerpretation_pyrenees). 

To do the exercise follow the instructions from the tutorial [document](fieldwork_tutorial.pdf).
